Its not everyday you get to meet royalty, let alone live with royalty.

Coyote clans member, Guardian of Corazon De Oro. Connoisseur of all things fowl.

Regal, selectively deaf, kind and caring are a few words that can begin to describe this king.

In a time of being lost, scared, alone, and unsure of the future, Rocky welcomed me into his kingdom.

Land of healing echoes with his regality.

Bound to this land, but in his castle he was never caged.

Silent surveying his fiefdom, he always follows his compass of a nose.

Old but not frail, his will never curtailed, 15 years overlooking his domain, the king sets down his crown and on the next journey he sets sail.

mi corazón de oro es la mañana quieta

He now joins Tom and Tessa.

Spicy as a hatch chilie, I thank you king for the wonderful memories.

You helped me rebuild my sails, you helped me build a family of golden hearts.

Thank you for everything Rocky.

Stay Spicy Rocky
