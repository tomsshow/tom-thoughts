How do you heal, when the remanence of pain lingers?

A constant reminder, a crimson letter.

Phantom wounds, phantom pains.

Who is with you when the glass breaks?

Memories like scars.

The bleeding has stopped long ago, but has the wound healed?

Thin and brittle, the barb breaks.

Subdermal // Subconscious.

"Be the Cholla"

Pain is indifferent. Blind. Equal Opportunist.

Reel with no end, a room of my own, always on.

I am in pain.

Is pain bad?

Pain is a signal of life.

I am constantly alive.

Resolution doesn't alleviate the pain.

So how do you move on when the scars still ache?

Or is the pain an indicator that you haven't moved on?

Pain is an indicator you are alive.

Pain is the spice of life.

Stay Spicy.
