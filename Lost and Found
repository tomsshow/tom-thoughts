Seas are rough.

The storm ripped the buoys like weeds from the garden.

How do you navigate when the north star isnt visable anymore?

"Calm waters a good sailor doesn't make" doesn't come to mind when I am not sure if im about to capsize.

...---...

A flair jets out of the barrel, eager to signal to others.

The torrent in the sky consumes the flair like a black hole; no light escapes.

...---...

Up, down, left, reality feels boggled as my mind is shaken by Davy Jone's cold grasp.

In the coner of my eye, a ship.

Hull the color of a field of wheat; inscriptions on the side pierce though the fog.

"Starboard"

The captain of this vessel heard my calls.

Tea warms the body, advice warms the soul.

Questions, possibilities, and the swollen gravity no longer take a toll.

"My world is spining around. Everything lost is now found."

The Starbord Way.

Stay Spicy Michael.
