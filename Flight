Take Flight little bird.

A canceled ticket is just an arbitrary word.

For the strength you gained to get out of the nest is only but the first step.

A raven's feather emblazoned.

New Frontiers await.

A path uncharted, a leap of faith.

Right and wrong is never clear. 

2 week extension; enjoy the unknown.

Stay Spicy little raven.
