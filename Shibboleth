Last night I was dreaming about a slab of wood.

Will this be a desk, a table?

Like a diamond in the rough, or a crystal ball yet to be polished, I see glimpses of its potential.

Both young with its few rings, and yet it felt weathered.

What life did this tree live?

Strange holes in the slab snickered at my admeration of the tree.

What could have casued them? Injury? Neglect?

Do I fill the holes and plane it? Dovetail?

I wake not knowing the answers to these questions.

I do not know what this dream as come to me.

I only wished to know more before its departure.

Am I the tree?

To be reclaimed after being knocked down?

What about the other parts of the tree?

Will the tree be whole again?

Will I?

What is being whole again really mean?

We are the culmination of bits of stars that were flung across million and millions of light years.

We became greater then the parts of our former whole.

Who will I be when I reclaim myself?

I am not sure, but I have coach helping me out through this one.

Stay Spicy Coach.
