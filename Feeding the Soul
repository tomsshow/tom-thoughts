You were always scared. Never going to fit in. 

Sentenced to be alone.

Being vs. Identity.

"Short Circuit Innovations".

"Frozen thoughts that seep into the mind."

Embraced by conversations, food, and the comforting idea that it will be ok.

Indulge the rabbit.

Engage the ideas. Nourish the mind. Maintain the body.

Thank you for helping me feed my soul.
