What does healing mean?

Healing implies a wound.

Wounds have scars.

Those memories still hurt.

A reminder etched into the skin.

How do you heal?

How does one begin to process emotions?

Is the proccess the removal of emotions?

Or to coexist with the idea or event?

I can't turn back time and undo these scars.

If I had the option, would I undo them?

Prob not.

The scars make me who I am.

Why do I feel ashamed about them?

Or do I feel regret of how things could have been.

A reminder etched in the memory.

Do we heal foe closure?

What if closure is never given.

Can you heal from something that feels empty?
