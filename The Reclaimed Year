I don't like New Years. Like a painting with holes, its just riddled with bad memories.

Saying 2021 was riddled with only bad memories doent do justice to the wonderful things that happened to me.

A year ago today I was in a hosital room taking care of my grandmother. 

I left a stable job I felt unchallenged at and took a chance with another opportunity.

A week after I accepted the new position my grandmother passed away.

The new oppostunity turned out to be the worst experience; but I met some of the best people along the way.

2021 was painfully acrid.

So many things taken away from me.

Not this year.

2022 will be the reclaimed year.

I did a lot of thinking while I in New Mexico. Maybe everything happens for a reason. Maybe not.

I need to stop making others happy at my own expense.

Reclaiming the mind, the body, the soul; thats the goal.

I don't know what will happen at the end of this journey. I dont know who I will be.

That is what I say before I came to this land of enchantment.

I reclamied this trip. I will reclaim this year.
