Today feels off.

My brain is mush.

The only thing that seemed like it made sense was making grilled cheese for dinner.

Butter and a little oil in the pan. Oil prevents the butter from burning.

2 slices of your preferred bread. Spread edge to edge with mayo. Both sides of the bread; 4 surfaces of mayo. 

Mayo has more fat content than butter or oil, so you get a better crust when it cooks.

The first side you place on the pan will be the inside of the sandwich. Let it cook for a little.

You can also use this side to gauged if the heat is on too hot.

Flip and lower the heat.

Add Mustard on the inside before you add your cheese. Just trust me on this.

You can add whatever else you want before you close the grilled cheese.

Tonight I added pickles and hatch chiles.

Close and toast the outside. The cheese will slowly melt as the outside is cooking.

Today felt off, but the grilled cheese tasted amazing.

Stay Spicy.
