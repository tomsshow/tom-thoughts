Healing springs, melt the layers of worry.

Deep were the layers.

Iron, Soda, by the cliffside.

Body renewed.

Caliente.

A whisper of words, crack open time.

Yesterday a child reassured, today a goal galvanized.

Spoon after spoon; words hide behind curiosity and wonder.

Soul Satiated.

My mind settles on an answer.

I thought, healed, and grew only in this magical land of enchantment; but its not home for me.
