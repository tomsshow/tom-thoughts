I felt strange when I awoke.

I am me, and yet I am not.

Tendrils of derangement had once bound me creep like echoes from the past.

Can I go back to sleep?

Was it all a dream?

3 full moons careen through the arroya.

From beyond the Junipers, he enters the scene.

An adobe castle built strong and true.

A forever bachelor pad, but if you knew him then its nothing new.

I came to your castle in search of who I am, 

the more I learned about me the more of you I started to understand.

A mystical land where your presence flows deep.

mi corazón de oro es la mañana quieta.

A castle where time, space and the junipers come to roost.

3 Full Moons, 3 Guardians, 3 neighbors, I will never forget.

Dreams and Reality intertwined.

Its time to wake up and become anew.

A profound impact from a person I never knew.

Rocky is doing ok, eating well, recieveing many pets and getting 3 walks a day.

I don't know what else to say except,

Thank you for all you have provided.
