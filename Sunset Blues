Like the enchanted Juniper, I am discovering how deep the roots go.

Conversations like the rain that fills up the arroyos.

Out of hibernation, freed from the shivers of sorrows.

Sunset blues.

Last night was a new moon; new beginnings.

The depth of the stars in the sky; how can something so dense feel like its dancing in the sky.

The layers of space, the milky way, it feels grounding.

This is the best universe because its the one I am in and get to experience.

The sky is different here.

Gradients of colors that can only be produced by magic.

Spectrums play hide and seek with the Jemez, Ortiz, Sandia.

A sunset that can only happen here.

"Because we fall, the climb must be our destination."

"How much further could we march if we were not forced to carry our fears on our backs?"

10,300ft. 6hr. 8mi.

The climb to sunset the blues.

No sunset after today will look the same.
