3 stones. 2 questions. 1 quest.

A torrent of fog crashing into a sea of trees.

A bow without an arrow. A fire smoldered from doubt.

Deep seeded roots gridling the trunk.

A reel on a spindle, a movie with infinite endings.

The raven caged by an idea, unable to find its new world.

Death before rebirth.

Saturn returns early.

A decision at the summer solstice. A conversation at the winter solstice.

A girl with brown willow hair.

I may never met her. Infinite possibilities, this future may not happen.

But that also means there is an infinite possibilites I will find her.

An infinite amount of outcomes where we share a future together.

I will make this come true.

I look forward to growing our roots together.

Until we are destined to meet,

Stay Spicy my beautiful willow tree.
